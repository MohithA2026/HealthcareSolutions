        <h1>Take Actions Before Taking Medicines</h1>
        <p> Prevention is Better tha Cure.</p>
        <p>We should have the basic idea of our health status and be aware of our own body.In the Places where there is
            underserved Healthcare we are providing the first aid and a basic health status of your Body.</p>
        <p>We also provide the nutritious diet and the healthy lifestyle to our customers.And follow the steps for your
            benifits</p>
        <p>The importance of preventive health care cannot be over-emphasized in the wake of shocking statistics of how
            health is deteriorating rapidly due to a lack of preventive measures. This grueling reality must have been
            on Elgin Moray’s mind when he said, “If prompt and effective action is not forthcoming, the medical services
            of the central and local authorities will go where the school of dental services has already gone down the
            drain” (British Medical Journal, 1949, p. 1416). Elgin made this observation many years ago but it is very
            relevant in today’s preventive medicine. It emphasizes the neglect that practitioners and stakeholders gave
            and still give to preventive healthcare.</p>
        <p>Well, as the old adage goes, prevention is better than cure. Preventive healthcare results in reduced
            mortality rates and this consequently increase life expectancy. Preventive medicine is significantly cheaper
            as compared to traditional medicine that many people prefer. Lack of preventive medicine puts individuals in
            danger of insalubrious lifestyles and varying food habits (Jekel, Katz and Elmore, 2001, p. 114). Being
            strong and big is not a sign of a healthy lifestyle. Someone may be strong and active but inside he or she
            harbors a health disaster waiting to strike. </p>
